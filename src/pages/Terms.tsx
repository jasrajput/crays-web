            <h3>3.1 Premium Service Definition.</h3>
            <p>
              Crays Premium Service is an optional, subscription-based, paid tier offered to you, which includes Crays Orange Check as defined in section 3.2 of this Agreement, increased media storage, and certain premium features, as defined on Crays 's Website.
            </p>

          <div class={styles.subsection}>
            <h3>3.2 Crays Orange Check.</h3>
            <p>
              Crays Orange Check is a service that provides a personalized username at Crays .net ("Crays Name") to all Crays Premium Service users. Crays Orange Check includes a verified Nostr Address at crays .net, Bitcoin Lightning Address at Crays .net, and a VIP profile address at Crays .net. By way of example, a user who selected "preston" as their Crays Name would have "preston@crays.net" as their verified Nostr Address, "preston@crays .net" as their Bitcoin Lightning Address, and "crays.net/preston" as their VIP profile address.

              Crays remains the exclusive owner of all Crays Names. Crays Name is rented, not sold, to you for the duration of your subscription, as defined in section 3.4 of this Agreement. Crays reserves the right to revoke any Crays Name at any time, without prior notice, if we determine that the name is trademarked by somebody else, that there is a possible case of impersonation, or for any other reason at our sole discretion. Purchasing a Crays Premium Service subscription grants you the right to use a Crays Name for the duration of the subscription, but Crays makes no guarantees that your selected name will remain available to you for the duration of your subscription. Should the name you have selected be revoked by Crays during your subscription term, you have the right to select another name, provided that this new name is available and acceptable to Crays.
            </p>

          <div class={styles.subsection}>
            <h3>3.4 Premium Service Duration.</h3>
            <p>
              Crays Premium Service will be offered for the duration specified during the purchase process. Crays will clearly display the expiration date of your subscription in your Premium Profile Settings. You are allowed to renew and extend your subscription at any time. Crays reserves the right to terminate your subscription for a cause, as described in Section 5 of this Agreement (Cancellation, Suspension, or Termination of Services).

          <div class={styles.subsection}>
            <h3>3.5 Expired Premium Subscription.</h3>
            <p>
              If you allow your Premium Service subscription to expire, you will lose all Premium Service benefits. Upon expiration, Crays will offer a Grace Period of seven days, during which your Premium Service benefits will continue to be available to you at no charge. After the expiration of the Grace Period, your Crays Name will no longer be associated with your Nostr account and will become available to another user to reserve. Your media storage in excess of the allotment offered to Free Tier users will be deleted from Crays 's servers.

          <div class={styles.subsection}>
            <h3>4.1 Premium Service Definition.</h3>
            <p>
              Crays Hosted Wallet Service is an optional service offered to you, which includes storing small amounts of bitcoin on your behalf, as defined in Section 4.3 Maximum Wallet Balance, the ability to send and receive bitcoin transactions on your behalf, the display of your transaction history, and hosting a Bitcoin Lightning Address assigned to you.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class={styles.subsection}>
            <h3>4.2 Crays Orange Check.</h3>
            <p>
              Bitcoin custody, send, and receive operations are performed by Crays 's affiliate Zap Solutions, Inc. ("Strike"). By using our Hosted Wallet Service, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, as well as Strike's Terms of Service, as defined at https://strike.me/legal/tos/. Crays reserves the right to change the Wallet Third Party Service provider without prior notice, or to bring some or all of these services in-house. All such changes will be reflected in an update to this Agreement, as further described in Section 9 (Changes to Agreement or Services).

          <div class={styles.subsection}>
            <h3>4.3 Maximum Wallet Balance.</h3>
            <p>
              The purpose of our Hosted Wallet Service is to provide an easy-to-use spending bitcoin wallet with minimal setup effort. You should not use the Crays Hosted Wallet Service to store amounts that exceed the value you would carry in a physical spending wallet. For larger amounts, Crays recommends self-custody, preferably in a bitcoin-specialized hardware wallet. Crays is enforcing a Maximum Wallet Balance to ensure that all users are using our Hosted Wallet Service for the purpose it was designed for. Your Maximum Wallet Balance is displayed in your Wallet Settings. If you attempt to credit your wallet with an amount that would exceed your Maximum Wallet Balance, you may need to contact Crays Support at support@Crays.net to get a refund.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class={styles.subsection}>
            <h3>4.4 Wallet Activation and Control.</h3>
            <p>
              When you activate your Crays Wallet and register for the Hosted Wallet Service, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information as prompted by the registration form. Your wallet is controlled by your Nostr private key (starting with "nsec") and the verified email address you provided during registration. It is your responsibility to keep your Nostr private key secret and safely stored, as well as to ensure that nobody else has access to the email account you used to register for our Hosted Wallet Service. If either your Nostr private key or your email account get compromised, this may result in loss of funds in your Crays Wallet. Crays assumes no responsibility nor liability for loss of funds resulting from a compromised private key and/or email account.

          <div class={styles.subsection}>
            <h3>4.5 Transaction Fees.</h3>
            <p>
              Transaction fees for incoming and outgoing payments within your Crays Wallet are a combination of bitcoin network fees, fees charged by Crays 's affiliates (if any), and fees charged by Crays (if any). Transaction fee policy is subject to change without notice. Crays Wallet will clearly display the fees charged for each transaction on the Transaction Details screen.
            </p>

          <div class={styles.subsection}>
            <h3>4.6 In-app Purchase Fees.</h3>
            <p>
              Crays Wallet offers the ability to purchase small amounts of bitcoin, typically in USD $5 increments, via the Apple/Google in-app purchase. Apple and Google charge a considerable fee for these transactions. Prior to your purchase, Crays will clearly display the exact amount of bitcoin (expressed in satoshis) that you will receive for the specific fiat amount you will be paying. Crays makes no revenue from in-app purchases. All in-app purchases are final, Crays offers no refunds.

            <p>
              All payments made via the Crays Hosted Wallet Service are final. If a mistaken or unauthorized transaction occurs, you will need to contact the payee directly to recover the funds. Crays accepts no liability for mistaken or unauthorized transactions.
            </p>

          <div class={styles.subsection}>
            <h3>4.8 Taxes.</h3>
            <p>

It is your responsibility to report and remit any such tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Crays is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your use of the Services, including your transactions, or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from your use of the Services.
